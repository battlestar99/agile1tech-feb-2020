OOP -  

object oriented programming 

java , C# 

class - object is the center of our programming paradigm 

class - main method of java - procedural programming - line after line - java application 

class - non-runnable class - not having the main method - OOP 
storage of functions 


design or prototype of an object/ any number of objects 

class - functions, properties 

it can do something - functions 
it has some attributes - properties 



car 

int mileage; 
go()
assert.assertequals()

class
object
local variables
global variables
functions and properties 
this keyword
static 
constructor overloading 
method/function overloading 

access modifier - how we can access a function or properties outside of the class 

public - works everywhere 
private - only works within the class
protected - works within class and outside of the class but inside the same package
no modifier - protected 

inside the same class - public, private, protected 
outside the class but inside the package - public, no private, protected
outside the class also outside the pacakge - public, no private, no protected 

Relation between classes - 

inheritance - one class can inherit the properties and function of other class 

parent class - super class
child class - sub class 

sub class gets everything from super class, but super class doesn't get anything from sub class 

multiple inheritance 


car - superclass
honda - subclass 
accord - subclass of honda 




abstract class - we can not create any object of the abstract class, and we can only use through
their sub class 

interface - create an outline for set of classes

webdriver is an interface 

chromedriver, mozila driver, ie driver all implementing the webdriver interface 


webdriver 
chromdriver - sendkeys 

iedriver - sendkeys
