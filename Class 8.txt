how to interact with web elements? 

java - function 

Selenium - programming 
libraries - jar files 
we want to interact with web based application 

validate a requirment 
Test Case - step by step instructions of how we execute a test 
pass/fail criterion 
comparing actual with expected value 
expected - we should know that before we exectue test - requirement docs - 
actual - after executing test case 
if value same - test case passes 
if not - fails 

defect/bug 

manually test it - 

log the defect or bug 

Test case 

step 1 : opening a browser
step 2: navigatin to url 
step 3 : entering username
step 4: enter password
step 5: click on submit button
step 6: user should be in home page after login 

Test Script : 

it has to validate something 
compare actual and expected values 
we need to generate report 
Test suite 

TestNG 
Cucumber 

problem : 

1. if we find web elements in our test scripts, we need to find the same web elements multiple times
in different scripts

2. if the location of any webelement changes, we have to find it in different scripts and change 
it

seperating web elements from test scripts - object driven framework 
page object model - is a non runnable that can have functions to find web elements 
for every web page you are going to test  - you should have one page object model class
that page object model class will have all the web elements of the page 
constructor - to setup some initial value for an java object 





seperating test data from test scripts - data driven framework 

relative and absolute xpath
implicit wait - thread.sleep 


<input type="text" class="inputtext _58mg _5dba _2ph-" data-type="text" 
name="firstname" value="" aria-required="true" placeholder="" 
aria-label="First name" id="u_0_m" 

relative xpath - double slash 

//*[@id="u_0_m"]



absolute xpath - single slash
/html/body/div[1]/div[3]/div[1]/div/div/div/div[2]/div[2]/div/div[1]/div/div[1]/form/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div/div[1]/input
