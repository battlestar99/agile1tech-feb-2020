How to manage code when working in a team? 

Why to use Maven? 


What is git and github, commands? 


What is CI/CD, why to use jenkins? 








Good Afternoon 
Class will start 06:10 PM 

1. we need to share our code - git/github 

2. we need a project that is shareble - everyone using the same version of library - needs to be imporable


3. remote server - CI/CD - jenkins

DevOps - 
developer - develop the code
tester - testing the code or the application
devops - code mangement and application managment 

SDET - 
qa analyst, automation tester, qa engineer 


Maven - build managment tool for our code , gradle, ant 

compile - syntax error -.jave file compile - .class file is created 
run - 

build management system by creating a maven project 

maven is also a repository system - all java library - 95% of java library 

iphone - appstore 
android - play store 

plan to run your code from command line 

5 testers - 3 automatoin testers 

you have to work in same project - same one project 

pom.xml
project object model - the control center of maven project or heart of maven project 


quickstart - 


github - web repository 

git - version control tool, push and update our code 

git repository - a folder that we are tracking for any changes 

local git repository - in our local computer 

remote git repository - github, bitbucket 

git init 

git status 
git add * 
git commit -m "message"


git config email "test@test.com'
git config name "michael"


local has update file - remote has not - git push 

push the local to update the remote 

remote has update file - that local does not have - git pull 

push updating the remote 
pull updating the local 

if remote has updates that local doesn't have - you must have to pull first 

git status
git add * 
git commit -m "message"
git push -u origin master
git pull 

some other command 
git init
git remote add origin http://www.something



want to have repo in your local - 

download / clone 

download - will not make the folder a git repo 

git init
git 

Jenkins CI/CD 

jenkins in your local computer - jenkins can run code locally 

jenkins is setup in remote - 

CI/CD - 

triggering condition - developer push new code to the repo

pushing it to the repository - jenkins is fetching the code from the repo and run it in the server 

run the tests in the local machine and push the code to the repo
