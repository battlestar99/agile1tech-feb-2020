Java - programming language 
selenium - interact with web elements



Test results 
Test scripts should be organized - 
Test suits - collection of test cases 
data driven testing - getting data outside of the test scripts 

Testing Library - Testing framework 
TestNG - Junit 
Cucumber

we need a plugin for the library in eclipse 
The structure of the library is creared - we need insert our code in that specific structure 

Control the squence of the test is annotations

lets setup TestNG 

TestNG library - jar file 
TestNG plugin - eclips plugin for TestNG 


user story: 

creating a new module for new user to sign up through google accounts 



validate 10 different things - 10 test cases 
validate 1 thing - 1 test case 

manual test cases - 1,10

automation test scripts - 

Test case: 

1. opening up google chorme browser
2. naviagating to the home page 
3. user should find out the local link
4. clicking the local link should navigate to local page
5. user should find specific local page title and url
6. user should be able to use the browser back option to return to home page 


TestNG 

we dont need main method of java anymore 

works on annoatations - and annotations have specific sequence 

each annotation comes with a function - when we tell the annoation will execute the function 
corresponded with the annoation get executed 

1 class - 1 test script - 1 Test annotation - we can have multiple annoations

BeforeTest
Test - where we write our test 
AfterTest
